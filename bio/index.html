  I graduated from Arts University of Bournemouth in June 2019 and I am now living in Manchester. My degree in photography involved a great deal of creativity, researching, shooting, editing, collaborating, networking and exhibiting.
  <br>
  I am interested in fashion, street style and portraits as I love collaborating with people. I have had experience assisting photographers, freelance photoshoots and a job as a photographer at a modelling agency.
